# Star-Me
Starring is fun!

The script in this repository connects developers automatically with FOSSASIA projects on GitHub. You need to run the script in your Chrome browser developer console.

# Steps

## 1. Sign In
Make sure that you are signed in your GitHub account, if not do so now!

## 2. Copy the Script
Open star.user.js [at this link here](https://github.com/fossasia/star-me/blob/master/star.user.js) and copy the entire script.

## 3. Open Developer Tools in Your Browser

Make sure you are on a tab with an open GitHub page and open developer tools.

### For Linux and Windows Users
To open developer tools on Chrome/Chromium please press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>

### For macOS Users using Chrome/Chromium
To open developer tools please press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>


### It should look something like this:

![This is the image where the developer tools should be but for some reason or another it is not displayed :(](./docs/chrome-dev-tools.png)

## 4. Open the Console tab in the Developer Tools
Click on the `Console` tab in the developer tools to open it, then click on the text area in the Console tab.

Ensure you are still on a browser tab that has GitHub open.

## 5. Paste the Script
Paste the script by pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> if you are on Windows or if you are on macOS press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>.

Then hit <kbd>return</kbd> / <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## 6. Wait until the script is finished
The script needs to run a few minutes. At the end it will display "Finally Over ;-)" in blue color. Ensure it runs until the end.
